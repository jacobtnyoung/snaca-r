# **Introduction**  
A great feature of RStudio is that you can create data-driven documents. That is, documents that use combine text and analysis into a "reproducible" documents. This is done using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). In other words, it allows you to write all of the text, syntax for the analysis, etc. and keep it in a document. This way you are not bouncing between programs and everything is reproducible. This is ideal if you are using a publicly available data set.

<br>

## **Getting Started**  
First, you need to install the `rmarkdown` package using:  

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages( "rmarkdown" )
```

<br>

Now, let's take a look at how it works. Open a new R Markdown file using the drop-down menu as shown below:  

<br>

<br>

Then, use the options to pick the type of file you want to create.

<br>

Afterwards, click on the knit function in the .Rmd pane:  

<br>

<br>

You did it!

## **Next Steps**  
Easy enough right? Great! That was a simple example, there is a *lot* more you can do. If you are ready to charge forward, then here are some helpful links:  

  * Get inspired by looking through the R Markdown [gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html).  

  * Walk through the R Markdown [lessons](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) in the R Studio website.

## **Some Examples**  
Take a look at the [RWorkshop github page](https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/RWorkshop). Click on the [topics](https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/RWorkshop/tree/main/topics) folder.  

You will see a `.Rmd` file for all of the sections we covered today. Let's look through a few.  

<br>

Here is another example. Take a look through the [Open Criminology Phoenix](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/OpenCrimPhx/) pages. In particular, take a look at this page examining [crime in Phoenix](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/OpenCrimPhx/crime-trends.html). This page is a .html file that is created using [this](https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/OpenCrimPhx/blob/main/crime-trends.Rmd) RMarkdown file.
