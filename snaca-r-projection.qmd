# Projection & Weighted Graphs {.unnumbered}

As discussed in the [Bipartite Graphs & Two-Mode Networks](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/snaca-textbook/snaca-bipartite.html) chapter of the textbook, bipartite graphs are useful for operationalizing contexts where nodes come from *two* separate classes. In contrast to one-mode networks, or unipartite graphs, where edges can be incident *within* a particular node/vertex set, in two-mode or bipartite graphs there are two partitions of nodes (called modes), and edges only occur *between* these partitions (i.e. not within).

Then, in the [Projection](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/snaca-textbook/snaca-projection.html) chapter, we saw that **projection** is the process by which we map the connectivity between modes to a single mode. And, we saw that we can use a weighted graph or a binarized graph in the analysis of the project.

In this tutorial, we will review how a unipartite or one-mode network can be created through projection.

## One-Mode Networks by Projection

Following @breiger1974duality, we can build the adjacency matrix for each projected network through matrix algebra. Specifically, multiplying an adjacency matrix by it's **transpose**. The transpose of a matrix *A* simply reverses the columns and rows: $\sf{A^T_{ij}}$ = $\sf{A_{ji}}$.

The two-mode, *NxM*, adjacency matrix, when multiplied by it's transpose, produces either:

-   An *NxN* matrix (ties among *N* nodes via *M*)

-   An *MxM* matrix (ties among *M* nodes via *N*)

To examine how this works, let's first set up an example:

```{r, create-example-matrix}

# create an example matrix
A <- rbind(
  c( 1,1,0,0,0 ),
  c( 1,0,0,0,0 ),
  c( 1,1,0,0,0 ),
  c( 0,1,1,1,1 ),
  c( 0,0,1,0,0 ),
  c( 0,0,1,0,1 )
  )

# name the rows and columns 
rownames( A ) <- c( "A","B","C","D","E","F" )
colnames( A ) <- c( "1","2","3","4","5" )

# print out the matrix
A

```

### Transposition

In R, the `t()` function, or `transpose()` returns the transposition of a matrix. To see the help on the `transpose()` function, just use `?t` to pull up the help page.

```{r}

# print the transpose of our example
t( A )

```

*What is different?* Compare the difference between `A` and `t( A )`.

#### Matrix Multiplication in R

To create the project, we need to use matrix algebra. To multiply matrices in R, we have to use the following operator: `%*%`. This is different then `*` in that `%*%` tells R to use matrix multiplication. For example, compare the differences:

```{r, show-matrix-multiplication}

# create two matrices
a <- matrix( c(1,1,1,1), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE )
b <- matrix( c(2,2,2,2), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE )

# multiply the first element in a by the first element in b
a * b

# multiply the matrix a by the matrix b
a %*% b

```

*What is the difference?* When we use `a * b`, it is not using matrix multiplication.

To multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix. This is called *conformability*. Only matrices with *conformable* dimensions can be multiplied. For example, 5x6 X 6x5 works, but not 5x6 X 5x6. When two matrices are multiplied by each other, this renders the *product* matrix. The *product* matrix has the number of rows equal to the first matrix and the number of columns equal to the second matrix.

Recall that from the two-mode, *NxM*, adjacency matrix, we can produce two different matrices:

-   An *NxN* matrix (ties among *N* nodes via *M*)

    -   This is created by using *NxM* X t(*NxM*), or *NxM* X *MxN*

-   An *MxM* matrix (ties among *M* nodes via *N*)

    -   This is created by using t(*NxM*) X *NxM*, or *MxN* X *NxM*

Let's create each of these with our example network.

```{r, show-transpose-function}

# create the NxN matrix
A %*% t( A )

# create the MxM matrix
t( A ) %*% A

```

## Projections

### The Person Matrix

Ok, so we have created the projections, which are the one-mode networks that represent information in the two-mode networks. Recall from the [Projection](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/snaca-textbook/snaca-projection.html) chapter that @breiger1974duality referred to the *person* matrix (i.e. the *NxN* matrix) and the *group* matrix (i.e. the *MxM* matrix).

```{r, create-projection}

# create the "person" matrix: recall this is A X t(A)
P <- A %*% t( A )

P

```

*What does the diagonal represent in this matrix? What do the off-diagonal elements represent?*

The *diagonal* elements represent the number of nodes in the second mode of the bipartite graph to which a node is connected. Put differently, if we have a **two-mode network** where one set of nodes are individuals and the other set of nodes are events, then the *diagonal* of the projection for the "person" matrix represents the number of events that an individual attended.

The *off-diagonal* elements represent the ties between nodes in the same node set of the bipartite graph. That is, ties between individuals.

To visualize this by plotting each network, then we can better see what is happening. We will use the `gplot()` function, so be sure to call the `sna` package library.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}

# call the library
library( sna )

# set the plot regions to ease with visualization
par( 
  mfrow = c( 1, 2 ),
  mar = c( 0, 1, 4, 1)
  )

# set the seed to reproduce the plot
set.seed( 507 )

# plot the bipartite network
gplot( A,
       gmode = "twomode",
       main = NA,
       usearrows = FALSE,
       label = c( "A","B","C","D","E","F", "1","2","3","4","5" ),
       label.pos = 5,
       vertex.cex = 2,
       vertex.col = c(                   # create a vector of colors
         rep( "#fa6e7a", dim( A )[1] ),  # the first color is the number of nodes in the first mode
         rep( "#00aaff", dim( A )[2] ) ) # the second color is the number of nodes in the second mode
       )
title( "Bipartite Matrix", line = 1 )

# plot the person matrix
gplot( P,
       gmode = "graph",
       label = c( "A","B","C","D","E","F" ),
       main = NA,
       usearrows = FALSE,
       label.pos = 5,
       vertex.cex = 2,
       vertex.col = "#fa6e7a",
       vertex.sides = 99.      # set the shapes to be circles
       )
title( "Unipartite Projection of\n Person Matrix", line = -1 )


```

From the plots we can see what the projection is doing. It is creating a unipartite graph based on the ties in the bipartite graph. For example, consider nodes *A*, *B*, and *C*. In the bipartite graph, *B*, is connected to *A* and *C* through node *1*. We see this in the unipartite graph where *A*, *B*, and *C* are connected. In other words, we have taken the links between *A*, *B*, and *C* in the bipartite graph and reproduced them in a unipartite graph.

### The Group Matrix

Now, let's take a look at the "group" matrix. The projection for the "group" matrix has a different interpretation. Let's work through this to see it.

```{r}

# create the "group" matrix: recall this is t(A) X A
G <- t( A ) %*% A

G

```

*What does the diagonal represent in this matrix? What do the off-diagonal elements represent?*

The *diagonal* elements represent the number of nodes in the first mode of the bipartite graph to which a node is connected. If we have a **two-mode network** where one set of nodes are individuals and the other set of nodes are events, then the *diagonal* of the projection for the "group" matrix represents the number of individuals that attend an event. The *off-diagonal* elements represent the ties between events. Essentially, how events are connected by people attending them. Let's plot this to see it.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}

# call the library
library( sna )

# set the plot regions to ease with visualization
par( 
  mfrow = c( 1, 2 ),
  mar = c( 0, 1, 4, 1)
  )

# set the seed to reproduce the plot
set.seed( 507 )

# plot the bipartite network
gplot( A,
       gmode = "twomode",
       main = NA,
       usearrows = FALSE,
       label = c( "A","B","C","D","E","F", "1","2","3","4","5" ),
       label.pos = 5,
       vertex.cex = 2,
       vertex.col = c( 
         rep( "#fa6e7a", dim( A )[1] ), 
         rep( "#00aaff", dim( A )[2] ) )
       )
title( "Bipartite Matrix", line = 1 )

# plot the person matrix
gplot( G,
       gmode = "graph",
       label = c( "1","2","3","4","5" ),
       main = NA,
       usearrows = FALSE,
       label.pos = 5,
       vertex.cex = 2,
       vertex.col = "#00aaff",
       vertex.sides = 4        # set the shape to be a square
       )
title( "Unipartite Projection of\n Group Matrix", line = -1 )

```

From the plots we can see what the projection is doing. It is creating a unipartite graph based on the ties in the bipartite graph, but this time it is for the other node set. For example, consider nodes *1*, *2*, and *3*. In the bipartite graph, *1*, is connected to *2* through node *A* and *C*. Node *2* and *3* are connected through node *D*. We see this in the unipartite graph where *1* is connected to *2* and *2* is connected to *3*. In other words, we have taken the links between *1*, *2*, and *3* in the bipartite graph and reproduced them in a unipartite graph.

## Projecting [Young & Ready's (2015)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1043986214553380) Police Officer Network

Now, let's work with a real example. As discussed in the [Bipartite Graphs & Two-Mode Networks](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/snaca-textbook/snaca-projection.html) chapter, @young2015 examined how police officers develop cognitive frames about the usefulness of body-worn cameras. They argued that police officers' views of body-worn cameras influence whether they use their cameras in incidents and that these views partly result from sharing incidents with other officers where they exchanged views about the legitimacy of body-worn cameras.

his network is available in `SNACpack` under the name `officer_event_net`. We can type the name of the network to see it's properties:

```{r}

# load SNACpack 

library( SNACpack )


# print out the network

officer_event_net

```

The `officer_event_net` object is stored as one of class `network`. Let's coerce it to a matrix to make it easer to handle:

```{r}

officer_event_mat <- as.matrix( officer_event_net )

```

We can check the dimensions of the matrix using the `dim()` function. The `officer_event_mat` matrix has `r dim( officer_event_mat )[1]` rows and `r dim( officer_event_mat )[2]` columns. Recall that this is police officers and incidents, so there are `r dim( officer_event_mat )[1]` police officers and `r dim( officer_event_mat )[2]` incidents that connect officers.

```{r}

# identify the number of police officers
N <- dim( officer_event_mat )[1]

# identify the number of incidents
M <- dim( officer_event_mat )[2]

```

### Create the Projections

Now that we have it put together, let's create the projections. To do this, we just need to employ matrix multiplication on the `officer_event_mat` matrix.

```{r}

# create the "person" matrix
officer_event_mat_P <- officer_event_mat %*% t( officer_event_mat )

# create the "group" matrix
officer_event_mat_G <- t( officer_event_mat ) %*% officer_event_mat

```

Now, let's plot the networks!

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}

# set the plot regions to ease with visualization
par( 
  mfrow = c( 2, 2 ),
  mar = c( 2, 1, 4, 1)
  )

# set the seed to reproduce the plot
set.seed( 507 )

# plot the bipartite network
gplot( officer_event_mat,
       gmode="twomode",
       usearrows=FALSE,
       edge.col="grey60",
       vertex.col = c( 
         rep( "#34e5eb", dim( officer_event_mat )[1] ), 
         rep( "#4f0a1a", dim( officer_event_mat )[2] ) ),
       edge.lwd=1.2
       )
title( "Bipartite Matrix of Officers and Incidents", line = 1 )

# plot the person matrix
gplot( officer_event_mat_P,
       gmode = "graph",
       usearrows = FALSE,
       edge.col="grey60",
       edge.lwd=1.2,
       vertex.col = "#34e5eb"
       )
title( "Unipartite Projection of\n Officers (Person) Matrix", line = 1 )

# plot the group matrix
gplot( officer_event_mat_G,
       gmode = "graph",
       usearrows = FALSE,
       edge.col="grey60",
       edge.lwd=1.2,
       vertex.col = "#4f0a1a",
       vertex.sides = 4
       )
title( "Unipartite Projection of\n Incidents (Group) Matrix", line = 1 )

```

Now that we have reduced our bipartite graph to a unipartite graph, we can employ the same descriptive tools we have previously used.

### Using the Weights in the Plot

Note that when we create the projection, the matrix is actually a weighted matrix. We saw this in the [Projection](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/snaca-textbook/snaca-projection.html) chapter. We can use this information in our plot. That is, we can use the weighted matrix to shade the edges (darker are larger weights) and size the edges (where larger are bigger weights). To see how this works, let's build a few functions.

#### The `edge_rescale()` and `edge_shade()` functions for incorporating edge weights

As we have seen in prior tutorials, the `vertex_rescale()` function can be used to rescale the size of the *nodes* in a plot based on an attribute. We can do the same thing for *edge* values. That is, we can make edges that have larger values in the projection to be thicker and darker and smaller values to be thinner and lighter. This helps us better visualize the weights assigned to the edges. In `SNACpack`, there are two functions that do just that: `edge_rescale()` and `edge_shade`. (Use `?edge_rescale` and `?edge_shade` to see more about the function in the help file).

Now, let's plot the networks with the edges adjusted. We will plot the bipartite graph, the officer network, and the officer network with the shading.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}

# set the plot regions to ease with visualization

par( 
  mfrow = c( 1, 3 ),
  mar = c( 2, 1, 5, 1)
  )


# plot the bipartite network

gplot( officer_event_mat,
       gmode="twomode",
       usearrows=FALSE,
       edge.col="grey60",
       vertex.col = c( 
         rep( "#34e5eb", dim( officer_event_mat )[1] ), 
         rep( "#4f0a1a", dim( officer_event_mat )[2] ) ),
       edge.lwd=1.2
       )

title( "Bipartite Matrix of Officers and Incidents", line = 1 )


# plot the person matrix

set.seed( 507 )

gplot( officer_event_mat_P,
       gmode = "graph",
       usearrows = FALSE,
       vertex.col = "#34e5eb"
       )

title( "Unipartite Projection of\n Officers (Person) Matrix\n (no shading)", line = 1 )


# plot the person matrix

set.seed( 507 )

gplot( officer_event_mat_P,
       gmode = "graph",
       usearrows = FALSE,
       edge.col = edge_shade( officer_event_mat_P ),           # note the usage here
       edge.lwd = edge_rescale( officer_event_mat_P, 0.1, 5 ), # note the usage here
       vertex.col = "#34e5eb"
       )

title( "Unipartite Projection of\n Officers (Person) Matrix", line = 1 )

```

Now, we will plot the bipartite graph, the incident network, and the incident network with the shading.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}

# set the plot regions to ease with visualization

par( 
  mfrow = c( 1, 3 ),
  mar = c( 2, 1, 4, 1)
  )


# plot the bipartite network

gplot( officer_event_mat,
       gmode="twomode",
       usearrows=FALSE,
       edge.col="grey60",
       vertex.col = c( 
         rep( "#34e5eb", dim( officer_event_mat )[1] ), 
         rep( "#4f0a1a", dim( officer_event_mat )[2] ) ),
       edge.lwd=1.2
       )

title( "Bipartite Matrix of Officers and Incidents", line = 1 )


# plot the group matrix

set.seed( 507 )

gplot( officer_event_mat_G,
       gmode = "graph",
       usearrows = FALSE,
       vertex.col = "#4f0a1a",
       vertex.sides = 4
       )

title( "Unipartite Projection of\n Incidents (Group) Matrix\n (no shading)", line = 1 )


# plot the group matrix

set.seed( 507 )

gplot( officer_event_mat_G,
       gmode = "graph",
       usearrows = FALSE,
       edge.col = edge_shade( officer_event_mat_G ),           # note the usage here
       edge.lwd = edge_rescale( officer_event_mat_G, 0.1, 5 ), # note the usage here
       vertex.col = "#4f0a1a",
       vertex.sides = 4
       )

## Tutorial Summary

This tutorial introduced crime analysts to the concept of projecting bipartite networks into unipartite networks, a critical technique for analyzing relational structures involving two distinct sets of nodes, such as people and events. We showed how analysts can create projections by multiplying an adjacency matrix with its transpose to generate either a "person" matrix, representing relationships between individuals, or a "group" matrix, representing connections between events. Visualization techniques using the `gplot()` function were demonstrated, showing how unipartite graphs are derived from bipartite structures and how weighted edges can be used to represent the strength of connections. Through these methods, crime analysts gained tools to investigate patterns of collaboration, shared events, and broader social structures, providing valuable perspectives for understanding crime and enforcement dynamics.
